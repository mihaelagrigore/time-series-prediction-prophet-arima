# Time Series prediction - demand forecasting

This repo contains one notebook in which I do demand forecast on a Kaggle competition dataset ( from the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/discussion/62838'> Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge</a>)using smoothing methods, Prophet (+Neural Prophet), ARMA (and several of its versions).

How to use it: Open the Jupyter Notebook in this folder. You can clone it, download it or just read it here. There is also a link at the top of the Notebook which takes you to the same Notebook on Kaggle.
